# Wishlist

This project is a dynamic, user-friendly wishlist application built using Angular 18 and Node.js. With this app, users can effortlessly add items to their wishlist, specifying quantities and prices to automatically calculate the total price. Itâ€™s an ideal tool for anyone looking to keep track of potential purchases, plan a shopping list, or organize items by priority.

## Features

- **Add Items with Quantity and Price:** Easily add items to your wishlist along with their quantity and price, helping you keep an eye on your budget and make informed decisions.
- **Automatic Total Calculation:** The application automatically calculates the total price of all items on your wishlist, providing a quick overview of your potential expenditure.
- **Reorder Items by Priority:** With the drag-and-drop functionality, you can easily move items up or down the list to change their priority based on your preferences.
- **Versatile Use Cases:** While designed as a wishlist, this application can also be adapted for other uses, such as managing a grocery list, planning a shopping spree, or keeping track of items for a project.

## Important Notes

Before closing your browser, make sure to **save your wishlist**. If you close the browser without saving, you will lose access to any unsaved items.

## Running the Application

For easier access in the future, you can create a shortcut to the batch file (`.bat`) used to start the application. To do this:

1. Open batch file in the project directory.
2. Right-click the file and select *Create Shortcut*.
3. Move the shortcut to a convenient location, such as desktop.
4. Simply double-click the shortcut to run the application.

This will automatically start the Angular development server, backend server and open the application in the default web browser.
